# CNNdigitRec
toy example of digit recognition using convolutional neural networks

train and test have been obtained from the train file of kaggle "Digit Recognition" competition using a split of 80%-20%, obtaining 33600 training examples and 8400 test examples.

The code is the same of "LenetMnistExample", one of the examples of the deeplearning4j , except for the data loading part.
